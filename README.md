#TiTle of project : 
Sentiment Analysis of Public Opinion Poll for Election 2024


#Description:

This project focuses on conducting sentiment analysis of public opinion polls and opinions collected from YouTube comments regarding the 2024 election. Initially, sentiment analysis was performed on public opinion polls, followed by sentiments extracted from YouTube comments. The sentiment analysis aimed to gauge public sentiment towards Narendra Modi and the BJP government, identifying whether sentiments were positive, negative, or neutral. Various machine learning models were employed for analysis, including logistic regression, SVM, decision tree classifier, XGBoost classifier, and random forest classifier. Notably, the random forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 72%. The project utilizes two datasets: one for model training, containing public opinion data for Narendra Modi from 2019, and another for prediction, consisting of 2024 data to determine the sentiment and assess the likelihood of Narendra Modi's candidacy in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. 


#Datasets : 

There are two datasets:
1. training dataset available on kaggle and provided the dataset on this repository.
2. prediction dataset on kaggle and provided on the repository.

   
#Installation:

To use this project, simply access the Jupyter Python code provided in the repository.

#Usage:

Users can preprocess the dataset and then directly utilize the trained model for sentiment analysis.

##Data Source:

The primary data source for this project is YouTube comments. While the data is not directly available on platforms like Kaggle or any other structured format, the comments were utilized to create a structured dataset for analysis. The process involved extracting, preprocessing, and structuring the data to enable effective sentiment analysis.
