Sentiment Analysis of Public Opinion Poll for Election 2024


#Description:

This project focuses on conducting sentiment analysis of public opinion polls and opinions collected from YouTube comments regarding the 2024 election. Initially, sentiment analysis was performed on public opinion polls, followed by sentiments extracted from YouTube comments. The sentiment analysis aimed to gauge public sentiment towards Narendra Modi and the BJP government, identifying whether sentiments were positive, negative, or neutral. Various machine learning models were employed for analysis, including logistic regression, SVM, decision tree classifier, XGBoost classifier, and random forest classifier. Notably, the random forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 72%. The project utilizes two datasets: one for model training, containing public opinion data for Narendra Modi from 2019, and another for prediction, consisting of 2024 data to determine the sentiment and assess the likelihood of Narendra Modi's candidacy in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
